## 4. Content structure

### PHP stuff

[config.php](/config.php) loads the field config from [lib/fields/markdown.php](/lib/fields/markdown.php), which itself gets its props from the textarea field. Included an example to add a new prop.

### JS stuff

- [src/main.js](/src/main.js) registers both the `k-markdown` field and `k-markdown-input` component.
- [src/field/Markdown.vue](/src/components/field/Markdown.vue) extends the `textarea` field to get all the props, and uses the `k-markdown-input`.
- [src/input/MarkdownInput.vue](/src/components/input/MarkdownInput.vue) imports Codemirror and initializes an editor.

### CSS stuff

- [src/assets/css/_variables.scss](/src/assets/css/_variables.scss) provides a bunch of CSS variables from the panel's stylsheets. Most won't probably be useful, just copy-pasted it from another plugin for the moment.
- [src/assets/css/_codemirror-default.scss](/src/assets/css/_codemirror-default.scss) sets the default codemirror styling.
- [src/assets/css/_codemirror-custom.scss](/src/assets/css/_codemirror-custom.scss) sets some custom codemirror styling.
- [src/assets/css/styles.scss](/src/assets/css/styles.scss) imports them in this order, + sets a few styling for the field.
